A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. 
If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2,
or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

Given an array, we need to find the peak element.
As, the subportions of the array are increasing/decreasing ( only then we would be able to find peak ),
there are subportions of array which are sorted, so we could use binary search to get this problem done.
But exactly how ?


Case 1 : mid lies on the right of our result peak ( Observation : Our peak element search space is leftside )
Case 2 : mid is equal to the peak element ( Observation : mid element is greater than its neighbors )
Case 3 : mid lies on the left. ( Observation : Our peak element search space is rightside )

int start = 0;
int end = n-1;

while(start <= end) {
	int mid = start + (end - start)/2;
	if(nums[mid] > nums[mid-1] && nums[mid] > nums[mid+1]) return mid;   // if mid == peak ( case 2 )
	else if(nums[mid] < nums[mid-1]) end = mid - 1; // downward slope and search space left side ( case 1)
	else if(nums[mid] < nums[mid+1]) start = mid + 1; // upward slope and search space right side ( case 3 )
}

Some base cases :

The array could be strictly increasing or strictly decreasing and as we have 
to return any of the possible peaks, so we could add a condition to check whether the 1st
element/last element could be the peak ). This point is also supported by the fact that, 
we are looking for mid-1/ mid+1 ( and these indices are compremised for 0th index / n-1 th index 
respectively.

So, our complete code becomes


		if(nums.length == 1) return 0; // single element
        
        int n = nums.length;
        
		// check if 0th/n-1th index is the peak element
        if(nums[0] > nums[1]) return 0;
        if(nums[n-1] > nums[n-2]) return n-1;
		
    
    
		// search in the remaining array
        int start = 1;
        int end = n-2;
        
        while(start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start)/2;
            if(nums[mid] > nums[mid-1] && nums[mid] > nums[mid+1]) return mid;
            else if(nums[mid] < nums[mid-1]) end = mid - 1;
            else if(nums[mid] < nums[mid+1]) start = mid + 1;
        }
        return -1; // dummy return statement
