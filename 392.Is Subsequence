Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting 
some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.
(i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false

        int idx2=0;
        int count=0;
        
        
        while(idx1<s.length() && idx2<t.length()){
           
            if(s[idx1]==t[idx2]){
                idx1++;
                idx2++;
                count++;
            }
            
            else
                idx2++;
             }
        
        return count == s.length() ? true :false; 
        
    }
};
