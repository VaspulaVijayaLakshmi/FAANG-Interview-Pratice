Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3


//cyclic sort approach
//watch kunal's series on cyclic sort


class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        int i = 0;
 /* initially  i = 0;
 Input     : [3,2,4,2,1]
 
 here nums[0] = 3 is not at its right so if will get executed and it will swap 3 with 4. 
1st pass   :   [4,2,3,2,1]  // i=0

 here nums[0] = 4 is not at its right so if will get executed and it will swap 4 with 2. 
2nd pass  :   [2,2,3,4,1] // i=0

 here nums[0] = 2 is at its right so else will get executed and it will i++. 
3rd pass :     [2,2,3,4,1] //i=1

 here nums[1] = 2 is at its right so else will get executed and it will i++. 
4th pass :     [2,2,3,4,1] //i=2

 here nums[2] = 3 is at its right so else will get executed and it will i++. 
5th pass :     [2,2,3,4,1] // i=3

 here nums[3] = 4 is at its right so else will get executed and it will i++. 
6th pass :     [1,2,3,4,2]//i=4

here , at this pass i = 4 now it will check at 2 is at its right position or not but other 2 is there already so it will return true, so else will get execute, hence our i will get ++ and it will break the loop.  */

while(i < nums.length)

            {
                swap(nums,i,nums[i]-1);
            } 
            else
            {   
                i++;
            }
        }
        //It will check if correct element is at correct index or not if not then return element at wrong index //which value is obivously going to be index+1. **because of the contraint that the elements are in //range [1,n]**.
        for(int j=0;j<nums.length;j++)
        {
            if(nums[j] != j+1)
                return nums[j];

        return nums.length;

        int tmp = nums[f];
